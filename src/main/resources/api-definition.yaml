        OpenLMIS Stock Management is based around the concept of Stock Cards and the creation of a
        permanent ledger accounting for all changes to the Stock on Hand over time.
        Each Stock Card is composed of line items, each representing a specific change to a
        particular set of Stock in Inventory. These ledgers expect that they may be updated as part
        of a larger distributed system with occassional internet connectivity and so changes to the
        ledger may come out of order and after the physical change to stock on hand occurred.

        This service also has Resources for:
        * Perparing and submitting a Physical Inventory.
        * Stock Events:  the only way to update (write operation) a Stock Card.  Not only are
          these events the only way to change a Stock Card, one event is one atomic transaction
          to the type of Stock Event being described:  a single adjustment, a batch, a receipt, etc.
        * The types of Organizations (facility, free text).
        * Configuring the types of Reasons that might be given when adjusting, issuing, or
          otherwise accounting for stock.
        * Configuring the lists of valid desitnations and sources (places you may send and receive
          stock).

        This service does not currently support bin cards (ledgers for Stock in Inventory in a
        particular bin, room, shelf, etc), though it's expected that functionality will be added
        soon.
